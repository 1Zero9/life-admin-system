# Life Admin System

This repository contains the design, principles, and future implementation of a Life Admin system.

This is a long-lived family system intended to:
- capture life admin information with zero friction
- store documents as the source of truth
- make information easy to find and understand
- remain usable and understandable decades into the future

## Important

This repository is intentionally documentation-first.

The `docs/` folder defines the system’s intent, constraints, and behaviour.
All future code must conform to those documents.

If implementation decisions conflict with the docs, the docs win.

## Status

- Design phase: complete
- Implementation: not started
