# Life Admin System – Efficiency and Insight Layer

This system should surface opportunities to reduce friction, cost, and effort over time.

It is not a budgeting or spending tracker.

---

## Purpose of insights

Insights exist to:
- highlight things worth reviewing
- reduce inertia and forgotten decisions
- prevent overpaying due to inattention
- surface opportunities at low-friction moments

Insights should never create guilt or pressure.

---

## Types of insights

### Time-based
- Contracts not reviewed in years
- Renewals approaching
- Fixed-rate periods ending
- Review windows opening

---

### Cost-awareness
- Costs outside expected ranges
- Costs that have increased over time
- Services with poor value retention

---

### Duplication and overlap
- Multiple services serving similar purposes
- Legacy services no longer needed
- Old accounts still active

---

### Structural inefficiency
- Contracts rolling without review
- Loans on outdated terms
- Insurance renewed automatically without comparison

---

## Insight behaviour

Insights must be:
- Infrequent
- Contextual
- Clearly explainable
- Easy to dismiss
- Reversible

Silence is preferable to noise.

---

## What insights must NOT be

- Daily alerts
- Spend tracking
- Judgemental messages
- Optimisation pressure
- Financial advice

The user remains in control at all times.
