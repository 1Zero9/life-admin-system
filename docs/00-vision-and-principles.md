# Life Admin System – Vision and Principles

This system exists to reduce friction, stress, and cognitive load in managing family and personal life administration.

It is not a productivity tool.
It is not a budgeting app.
It is not a filing system.

It is a long-lived family asset.

## Why this exists

Life admin information arrives at the worst possible time, in the worst possible formats.
Expecting consistent organisation from busy people does not work.

This system assumes chaos and works anyway.

## Core principles

- Zero decision-making at intake
- Capture first, organise later
- Documents are the source of truth
- AI assists, humans decide
- Security without friction
- Longevity over novelty
- Simple enough for non-technical family members
- Valuable today, survivable decades from now

Any future decision that violates these principles is wrong, even if it is technically clever.
