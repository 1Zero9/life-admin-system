Vault UI Evolution
Initial Design (Layer 1 – Minimalist)

Date: 2026-01-04

Approach: Ultra-minimal, single-column list

No sidebar

No filters

No tabs

Search bar at top

Simple chronological list

Separate upload page

Philosophy:

Reduce cognitive load

Hide all complexity

Make it boring and calm

Scannable within seconds

This design prioritised clarity over capability and was intentionally constrained to validate the core ingestion and retrieval model.

Design Pivot: Single-Screen Vault UI

Date: 2026-01-04

Decision: Move to a structured single-screen interface with navigation, filtering, and a richer but controlled layout.

This remains Layer 1 (pre-AI).

Reasons for Change
1. Practical usability over theoretical minimalism

A real document vault will contain hundreds or thousands of items

Continuous scrolling does not scale

Search alone is insufficient for recall-based retrieval

Users need to browse by time and source, not just query text

Minimalism that impedes use is not calm, it is frustrating.

2. One-screen efficiency

All core actions are visible at once

No context switching between upload, search, and browse

Faster orientation and decision-making

A single, stable mental model reduces confusion

One well-designed screen is simpler than multiple sparse screens.

3. Information density without clutter

A structured table allows efficient scanning

Multiple attributes can be read at a glance

Visual hierarchy is created through layout, spacing, and typography

Information is organised, not hidden

Density is acceptable when it is predictable and calm.

4. Family member usability

Non-technical users benefit from visible, familiar patterns

Sidebar navigation and tables are widely understood

Filters prevent overwhelming “everything at once” views

Icons assist recognition without requiring learning

The system should feel obvious, not clever.

5. Long-term viability

The system must work after 5 to 10 years of use

Filtering by date and source is essential at scale

Core actions must be discoverable without instruction

A single screen prevents “where is that feature” confusion

This is a household system, not a demo.

What This Means
We keep

Zero decision-making at intake

Documents as the permanent source of truth

No AI features at this layer

Calm, neutral, trustworthy visual design

UK English and plain language

No tags, categories, or manual filing

We add

Left sidebar for navigation and scope control

Filter controls based on factual metadata only

Source type (email, upload)

Date range

Table-based layout with clear column hierarchy

File type icons for format and source recognition only

Integrated upload entry point in the main view

All primary interactions available on one screen

We explicitly reject

Status or importance badges

Colour-coded meaning

Tags or categorisation

Dashboards or analytics

Configuration or settings screens

Any AI-generated content at this layer

Core Principle Update

The system remains boring, durable, and understandable.

Minimal does not mean featureless.
Minimal means:

Every feature earns its place through utility

No interpretation or inference at this layer

No cognitive overhead during capture

Efficient, predictable access to stored documents

One well-structured screen is preferable to multiple sparse screens.

Layer 1 Contract (Non-Negotiable)

The following rules define Layer 1 and must not be violated:

Only factual, known metadata is visible

No inferred importance

No semantic meaning

Icons indicate format or source only, never priority

Upload is a single action with no prompts, choices, or required input

No AI summaries, tags, or planning features

No destructive actions without recovery

The UI must remain readable and calm at scale

Layer 1 answers one question only:

“Can I safely find what I am looking for?”

Next Steps

Implement the Single-Screen Vault UI with:

Left sidebar (navigation and scope)

Top bar (search and context)

Main table view with stable columns

Filters limited to source and date

File type icons with neutral styling

Clean, spacious, low-noise visual design

Only once Layer 1 feels boring, obvious, and trustworthy should Layer 2 (AI summaries) be introduced.
