# Life Admin System – AI Responsibilities and Limits

AI exists to reduce cognitive load and friction.

AI is an assistant, not an authority.

---

## What AI is responsible for

AI may:

- Classify life admin items after intake
- Extract facts such as dates, vendors, amounts, and references
- Generate plain-English summaries
- Link related items together
- Detect patterns over time
- Surface insights and review windows
- Improve understanding as more data becomes available

AI should work with incomplete or messy information.

---

## What AI must never do

AI must not:

- Delete original documents
- Replace documents with summaries
- Make irreversible decisions
- Hide uncertainty
- Act without human visibility
- Enforce actions or deadlines

Documents remain the source of truth at all times.

---

## Transparency requirements

When AI provides information, it should:

- Indicate confidence levels where appropriate
- Show which documents it used
- Allow humans to verify conclusions easily

---

## Trust model

Users should feel:

- In control
- Able to disagree
- Confident nothing is hidden
- Safe relying on the system

If AI behaviour causes doubt or confusion, it must be scaled back.
