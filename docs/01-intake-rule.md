# Life Admin System – Intake Rule

## The rule

If it’s life admin, it goes in. No questions.

## What this means

When something arrives that relates to running our lives as adults, it is captured in the system immediately.

This includes:
- emails
- letters
- PDFs
- photos
- screenshots
- notes from phone calls
- anything that would cause stress if lost

## What users do not do

- Decide where it belongs
- Decide how important it is
- Rename files
- Create folders
- Delay capture

## Why this rule exists

Life admin fails when organisation is required at the wrong moment.

This system removes decision-making at intake so it can work with real, busy humans.

If in doubt, capture it.
