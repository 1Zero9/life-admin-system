# Life Admin System – Core Concepts and Language

This document defines the shared language used by the system, its users, and any AI assisting it.

Words matter. These definitions must not drift over time.

## Core concepts

### Life Admin Item
Any document, message, note, or record related to running personal or family life.

Examples:
- bills
- contracts
- insurance documents
- letters
- screenshots
- notes from phone calls

A Life Admin Item may be messy, incomplete, or unclear at intake.

---

### Document
The original source material.

This may be:
- a PDF
- a photo
- an email
- a scanned letter
- a text extract

Documents are the source of truth and must never be hidden or replaced by summaries.

---

### Summary
A plain-English explanation generated for human understanding.

Summaries may change over time.
Documents do not.

---

### Insight
A surfaced observation that may be useful.

Examples:
- something has not been reviewed in years
- a contract is approaching renewal
- a cost appears high compared to typical ranges

Insights are suggestions, not instructions.

---

### Review Window
A period where it may be worth taking action.

Examples:
- before a renewal
- near the end of a fixed rate
- when switching friction is low

## What this system is NOT

- It is not a filing system
- It is not a task manager
- It is not a budgeting tool
- It is not a productivity tracker

If a feature pushes the system in these directions, it is wrong.

## Language to avoid

Avoid terms such as:
- folder
- task
- productivity
- optimise
- manage spending

Use human, life-based language instead.
