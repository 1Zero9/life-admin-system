# Life Admin System – User Experience and Habits

The success of this system depends on it fitting naturally into daily life.

It must feel easier than not using it.

---

## Core UX principle

Capture must be faster than thinking.

If using the system takes more effort than postponing, it will fail.

---

## Intake experience

Users must be able to capture items in seconds.

Acceptable actions:
- upload a file
- take a photo
- forward an email
- paste text
- add a short note

No mandatory fields.
No required decisions.

---

## Retrieval experience

Users should be able to:
- search by natural language
- browse recent items
- see related items automatically
- understand something without rereading documents

---

## Ongoing interaction

This is not a daily app.

Expected usage:
- intake when something arrives
- retrieval when something is needed
- occasional review prompted by the system

---

## Notification philosophy

- Notifications must be rare
- Notifications must be meaningful
- Notifications must be dismissible
- No guilt-based reminders

Silence is better than noise.

---

## Family adoption

The system must:
- be usable without explanation
- feel safe to use
- avoid “breaking something”
- encourage trust over time

If Jenny does not use it naturally, the system has failed.
