# Life Admin System – MVP Scope and Phasing

This document defines what the first usable version of the system must do, and what it deliberately will not do.

The goal is usefulness, not completeness.

---

## Definition of MVP

The MVP is successful if:
- Life admin items can be captured instantly
- Documents are safely stored
- Items can be found quickly
- Key facts can be understood without rereading everything

Nothing else is required for initial success.

---

## MVP must include

### Intake
- Upload files
- Capture photos
- Paste text or notes
- Forward emails into the system

No categorisation at intake.

---

### Storage
- Documents stored as-is
- Standard file formats only
- Metadata recorded automatically

---

### Retrieval
- Search by keyword
- Browse recent items
- View original documents easily

---

### Understanding
- Basic AI-generated summaries
- Visible link between summary and source document

---

## MVP must explicitly NOT include

- Budgeting
- Spend tracking
- Graphs and charts
- Complex dashboards
- Heavy integrations
- Automation that acts without review

These come later, if ever.

---

## Phase 2 (after MVP proves useful)

- Time awareness and reminders
- Review windows
- Insight surfacing
- Family access roles

---

## Phase 3 (only if needed)

- Efficiency benchmarking
- Offline archive generation
- Long-term legacy packaging
- Advanced AI assistance

Each phase must stand alone and justify its existence.
